# Encounter-Closer
Closes open encounters on VISTA that uses terminal emulation
The current VA VistA system will allow undeserved and unwanted open encounters to slip through a visit.  These encounters cannot be detected easily, and indicate an unfinished patient visit.  The goal of this system is to use current VA software to find, and allow the encounters to be closed.  The absolute rule of user programming on VA software (and I am a user) is that no techniques or tricks may be used on the system which are no9t within the ready capacity of the user - no newly introduced software, no attempts to break security, etc.  The innocent user (again, that's me) might write something that could be used to co-opt the VA software system as a whole, and that is not permitted.  The only programming used is that which is open to the sit-down user; no new software or goodies (unless permitted by VA ITO.)
